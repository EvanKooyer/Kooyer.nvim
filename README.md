# Kooyer.nvim - My personal neovim config

This is my terrible attempt at making my own config from scratch. This is likely
a lot of mess everywhere, but I want to fumble my way through it and learn this
tool.

## Dependencies

- C compiler (I end up just using zig)
- NPM

## Installation

I seriously don't think you will like this config. If you happen to want to try
and figure out my mess of a config, fork this repo and clone it to your config.

### Linux/Mac

```
git clone https://github.com/EvanKooyer/Kooyer.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

### Windows

for cmd.exe:

```
git clone https://github.com/EvanKooyer/Kooyer.nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

for powershell.exe:

```
git clone https://github.com/EvanKooyer/Kooyer.nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```
