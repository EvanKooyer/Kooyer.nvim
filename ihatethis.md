# I Hate This - Or "Using nvim this way feels wrong"

This file is a brain dump of the pain points I feel while using neovim. As i
have the time I can research ways to make this feel way better.

## To-Do

- [ ] configure render markdown to load all the rendering features i want
- [x] Set render-markdown to lazy-load
- [ ] Install refactoring.nvim for some refactoring code actions
