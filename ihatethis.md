# I Hate This - Or "Using nvim this way feels wrong"
This file is a brain dump of the pain points I feel with using neovim so
as I have time I can research ways to make this feel way better

## To-Do:
- I would love to add autocomplete after I get used to my overhaul of my nvim config
- Add descriptions to all of the keymaps scattered all over the place so which-key is actually useful
