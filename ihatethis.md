# I Hate This - Or "Using nvim this way feels wrong"

This file is a brain dump of the pain points I feel while using neovim. As i
have the time I can research ways to make this feel way better.

## To-Do:

- I would love to add autocomplete after I get used to my overhaul of my config
- Add descriptions to all of the keymaps scattered all over the place so
  which-key might be able to pick up on my custom keybindings.
